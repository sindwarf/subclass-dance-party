Methods to Implement:
  When you click a static dancer they turn into random movement dancers

Line up-------
  1. grab all dancers with dancer class
  2. put all dancer html elements into array (might be jQ object?)
  3. split array in 2 (x: 10%, x: 90%)
  4. get available y range (10%-90%), divide this range by # of dancers. This becomes our increment value when traversing arrays(step3) and positioning each dancer
  5. Set position of each dancer in array1 (step3) and array2, with respective X values
  6. Do css animation when re-positioning each dancer

Random Movement Dancer-----
  1. Make a new constructor class for randomly moving dancer
    a. Make a new random movement method that starts the random movement; ititiate itself inside constructor, call itself inside the setTimeoutCallback
    b. Make a method that handles movement and color change when hits edge of screen
    c.
  2. Make a new button that creates a RandMoveDancer
  3. New CSS Class
    a. Will need to handle colors, animations, size & shape

Circle Dancers----
  1. Make a new constructor class for a dancer with two shapes revolving around each other
  2. Make a a new button that creates Circle Dancers
  3. New CSS class



  Tools to use:
  - $(select the dancer).css('property', 'value')
  - animation of CSS positions (below)

Types of dancers:
  1. Dancer that moves away from your cursor
  2. Get cursor position
  3. Check all the dancer's positions every step
  4. if the dancer is within x amount of pixels, move the opposite direction
  5.


/* The animation code

var randomDirectionX = Math.random()*smallNum
var randomdirectionY = Math.random()*smallNum

animation-duration = 5s;
@keyframes example {
  0%   {background-color:red; left:0px; top:0px;}
  25%  {background-color:yellow; left:200px; top:0px;}
  50%  {background-color:blue; left:200px; top:200px;}
  75%  {background-color:green; left:0px; top:200px;}
  100% {background-color:red; left:0px; top:0px;}
} */
